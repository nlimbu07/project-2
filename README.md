## Concept & Motivation Behind SLM

- Managing multiple clients can be overwhelming, just as managing multiples of anything can be tasking.
- Our intention is to create a real-life application that is user-friendly and not too complex to use.
- An application that can be used in everyday life, regardless of occupation.
